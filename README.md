## Docker

### Build docker image

There is an Automated Build Task in Docker Cloud in order to build the Docker Image. 
This task, triggers a new build with every git push to your source code repository to create a 'latest' image.
There is another build rule to trigger a new tag and create a 'version-x.y.z' image

You can always manually create the image with the following command:

```bash
docker build -t systelab/r2d2 . 
```

### Run the container

```bash
docker run -p 8761:8761 systelab/r2d2
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:8080
